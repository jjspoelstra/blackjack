# Blackjack!
This project is a fairly simple blackjack game for one player. The game keeps track of all-time balance.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on creating a game that was fun to play and could be easily expanded upon in the future. 

# Optimizations
In the future, I would like to include a multiplayer functionality to the game, and have the ability to compare winnings across all users. 
Continued adjustment of the UI.

# Lessons Learned:
In this project, I have learned to take my time with larger processes and functionality. Having to go back and fix things that don't work because of simple little lines of code just takes up more time than is necessary. It's easy to want to rush through things, but in the end it is better and more efficient to walk yourself through what you are coding beforehand.
